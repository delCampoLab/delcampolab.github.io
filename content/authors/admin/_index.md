I am a microbial ecologist and Group Leader at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC–Universitat Pompeu Fabra) in Barcelona, and an Adjunct Professor at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami. I earned my Ph.D. in Environmental Microbiology and Biotechnology from the Institute of Marine Sciences (CSIC) in Barcelona, and went on to conduct postdoctoral research at the University of Barcelona, the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and later returned to the Institute of Marine Sciences. In 2019, I joined the University of Miami as an Assistant Professor, and in 2021, I became a Group Leader in Barcelona, where I now lead a research group exploring the intersection of marine biology, microbiology, and global change.

My lab investigates how corals and their symbiotic microbial communities respond to heat stress in the context of the climate crisis. We use a systems biology approach that combines high-throughput sequencing, computational biology, and bioinformatics to study the structure and function of these complex partnerships. By uncovering how microbial symbionts contribute to coral health and resilience, we aim to better understand, and ultimately help protect, marine ecosystems facing rapid environmental change.
