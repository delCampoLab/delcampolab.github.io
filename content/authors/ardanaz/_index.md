Since I began my studies in biotechnology, I have been driven by the desire to combine my technical background in molecular biology and genetic engineering with the potential of what omics and bioinformatics can provide to our knowledge, not only applied to humans but also in this case for environmental purposes .
During my undergraduate years and now, as I pursue my master’s in innovation and research in biotechnology, I have developed a strong interest in how advanced omics technologies and bioinformatics can unlock our understanding of microbiology. This motivation led me to apply for the CSIC’s JAE Intro ICU 2025 scholarship, as I saw it as the perfect opportunity to dive into marine microbiology and bridge the gap between lab-based engineering and environmental conservation.
Joining this laboratory will open me to the opportunity to complement my previous skills with high-level bioinformatic analysis, focusing on one of the most fascinating ecosystems in our seas. For my master’s thesis, I am studying the microbiome of the Chella Bank (Cabliers) reef. This site is truly unique: it is the only cold-water coral reef in the Mediterranean that continues to grow vigorously, acting as a pristine "oasis" of biodiversity that has survived for thousands of years.
My goal is to unravel the microbial secrets that allow this ecosystem to thrive, contributing to its protection while pushing the boundaries of what biotechnology can achieve in marine research.
