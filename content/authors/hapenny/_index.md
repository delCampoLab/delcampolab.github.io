I am a junior at the University of Miami pursuing a dual degree in Marine Sciences and Biology. In the past, I have worked in aquariums studying animal behavior and monitoring animal habitats. I have learned how animals rescued from the wild are rehabilitated and cared for if they are not released. Currently, I am working to learn as much as I can about potential career paths and am hoping to work closely with corals as I progress.
